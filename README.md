# Unity MCP Package

A Unity package that enables seamless communication between Unity and Large Language Models (LLMs) like Claude Desktop via the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. This server acts as a bridge, allowing Unity to send commands to and receive responses from MCP-compliant tools, empowering developers to automate workflows, manipulate assets, and control the Unity Editor programmatically.

Welcome to the initial release of this open-source project! Whether you're looking to integrate LLMs into your Unity workflow or contribute to an exciting new tool, I appreciate you taking the time to check it out!

## Overview

The Unity MCP Server provides a bidirectional communication channel between Unity (via C#) and a Python server, enabling:

- **Asset Management**: Create, import, and manipulate Unity assets programmatically.
- **Scene Control**: Manage scenes, objects, and their properties.
- **Material Editing**: Modify materials and their properties.
- **Script Integration**: View, create, and update Unity scripts.
- **Editor Automation**: Control Unity Editor functions like undo, redo, play, and build.

This project is perfect for developers who want to leverage LLMs to enhance their Unity projects or automate repetitive tasks.

## Installation

To use the Unity MCP Package, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Unity 2020.3 LTS or newer** (⚠️ Currently only works in URP projects)
- **Python 3.12 or newer**
- **uv package manager**

### Step 1: Install Python

Download and install Python 3.12 or newer from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure to add Python to your system’s PATH during installation.

### Step 2: Install uv

uv is a Python package manager that simplifies dependency management. Install it using the command below based on your operating system:

- **Mac**:

  ```bash
  brew install uv
  ```

- **Windows**:

  ```bash
  powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
  ```

  Then, add uv to your PATH:

  ```bash
  set Path=%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin;%Path%
  ```

- **Linux**:

  ```bash
  curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
  ```

For alternative installation methods, see the [uv installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

**Important**: Do not proceed without installing uv.

### Step 3: Install the Unity Package

1. Open Unity and go to `Window > Package Manager`.
2. Click the `+` button and select `Add package from git URL`.
3. Enter: `https://github.com/justinpbarnett/unity-mcp.git`

Once installed, the Unity MCP Package will be available in your Unity project. The server will start automatically when used with an MCP client like Claude Desktop or Cursor.

## Features

- **Bidirectional Communication**: Seamlessly send and receive data between Unity and LLMs.
